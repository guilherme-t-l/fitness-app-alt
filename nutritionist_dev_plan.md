## Success Metrics

### MVP Stage Completion Criteria
- **Stage 1**: Functional dual-panel layout with mock meal plan data
- **Stage 2**: AI chat can understand and modify meal plans via natural language
- **Stage 3**: Production-ready deployment with polished user experience

### Quality Gates
- All MVP features must be testable locally
- AI responses relevant and contextually appropriate for nutrition context
- Real-time synchronization between chat and meal plan panel
- Page load times under 2 seconds
- Mobile responsiveness on all major devices
- Basic error handling and user feedback

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Food database quality**: Use verified USDA data sources
- **AI hallucination**: Implement validation for all AI suggestions
- **Performance**: Implement caching and database optimization early

### Timeline Risks
- **Feature creep**: Stick to MVP for each stage
- **Integration complexity**: Test integrations early and often
- **Third-party dependencies**: Have fallback options for AI services

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start with Stage 1 - UI layout and dual-panel structure
2. **MVP Focus**: Complete Stages 1-3 for a working nutritionist chat interface
3. **Validate core concept**: Test AI-driven meal plan modifications with real users
4. **Gather feedback**: Share MVP with nutritionist stakeholders before expanding features
5. **Future expansion**: Move to Future Plans stages based on user feedback and needs

This streamlined plan focuses on delivering a working MVP quickly, validating the core concept of AI-powered meal plan assistance before investing in advanced features like comprehensive food databases and complex substitution algorithms.
